## AcControl
A simple API I use to determin the target temperature of my Daikin heat pump.
It takes the temperature reading of a indoor and outdoor sensor and calculates a suitable target for my house.

It also queries a weather forcasting service to check if it will be windy and adjusts the target slightly.

Sharing it mostly to learn about github and repositories :)
